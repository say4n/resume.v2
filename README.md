## structure

[`data`](/data) directory contains [YAML](yaml.lorg) files for each of the sections.

[`templates`](/templates) directory contains the template layouts for each of the sections.

[`build.py`](/build.py) is the build script that glues together the YAML data with the LaTeX layouts and generates the
final document. It can optionally push a release to this repository on a successful build.
